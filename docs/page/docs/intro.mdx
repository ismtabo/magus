# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Magus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new manifest**.

### What you'll need

- Magus CLI, install it downloading the latest release from <ReleasesPageLink title="here"/> 
or using `go install github.com/ismtabo/magus@latest`.

## Create a new manifest ðŸ“œ

To create a new manifest create a YAML file with the following content:

```yaml
version: "1"
name: hello-world
root: .
casts:
  hello-world:
    to: ./hello-world.md
    from: |
      # Hello World
      This is my first cast!
```

This manifest represents a magic, a set of casts that will generate a source file from the template you define.

Each cast have a `to` and a `from` field. The `to` field is the path where the cast will generate the source file. The `from` field is the template that will be used to generate the source file.

In addition, cast may be conditionally rendered or generated for a bunch of items from a collection. We will see this later.

## Spell your casts ðŸ§™

Now that you have a manifest, you can **spell your casts**.

```bash
magus generate hello-world.yaml
```

This command will generate the source files from the casts defined in the manifest, and will print the result in the standard output.

```markdown
<!-- file: hello-world.md -->
# Hello World

This is my first cast!
```

See the [Casts](./tutorial-basics/casts.md) section in the docs for more information.

## Using variables

You can use variables in your casts. Variables are defined in the manifest and can be used in the casts. These variables are contained 
in the `variables` field of the manifest and at each `cast`.

```yaml
version: "1"
name: hello-world
root: .
variables:
  - name: "name"
    value: "World"
casts:
  hello-world:
    to: ./hello-world.md
    from: |
      # Hello {{ .name }}
      {{ .description }}
    variables:
      - name: "description"
        value: "This is my first cast!"
```

If you run again the `generate` command, you will see that the `name` variable is used in the cast.

```bash
magus generate hello-world.yaml
```

```markdown
<!-- file: hello-world.md -->
# Hello World
This is my first cast!
```

By default, Magus will use the `variables` defined in the manifest. However, you can override these variables by passing them as flags to the `generate` command.

```bash
magus generate hello-world.yaml --var name=Magus
```

```markdown
<!-- file: hello-world.md -->
# Hello Magus
This is my first cast!
```

**Caveat:** flag variables will be considered as strings. If you need to use a different type, you can use the `--var-file` flag to pass a YAML or a JSON file with the variables.

```bash
magus generate hello-world.yaml --var-file variables.yaml --var-file variables.json
```

```yaml
# file: variables.yaml
name: Magus
number: 100
boolean: true
```

```json
// file: variables.json
{
  "name": "Magus",
  "number": 100,
  "boolean": true
}
```

See the [Variables](./tutorial-basics/variables.md) section in the docs for more information.

## Validating your manifest

You can validate your manifest using the `validate` command.

```bash
magus validate hello-world.yaml
```
