# All Together

Magus allow you to create multiple source files base on the YAML manifest. You can use the `magus` command to generate the source files. Source generation are known as **casting**. Casting is the process of generating source file based on a input template, an output path, a set of variables, and optionally a condition or a collection of items over which the template is rendered.

Variables can be either literals, templates or obtained from the environment. They are used in the render of paths, templates, and conditions.

Finally, Magus provides a set of helper functions that can be used in the YAML manifest. Helper functions are used in the render of paths, templates, and conditions.
